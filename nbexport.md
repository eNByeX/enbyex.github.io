##About
The NoteBlock Exporter allows you to convert Note Block songs into the following formats:

- **Schematic**
- **MIDI**
- **Lua**
- *More to be added*

The exporters are greatly configurable. Below is an overview of some exporters.

###Schematic
The schematic exporter allows you to import your Note Block songs into Minecraft.

Highlights:

- Can directly export Wireless Note Block songs!

    Because this is built-in, it limits neither how many notes you can play at once, nor how many instruments you can have.
- Support for custom instruments!
- Command Block Songs!

    Command Blocks can specify volume, unlike vanilla Note Blocks.
- Support for 20 TPS songs!

###Lua
The Lua exporter allows you to play your Note Block songs from a ComputerCraft/OpenComputers computer.

Highlights:

- Works with ComputerCraft and OpenComputers!
- Support for custom instruments!
- Support for volume!
- Support for 20 TPS songs!
