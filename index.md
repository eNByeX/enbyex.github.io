#### About
The NBX Project is a project with the goal of making tools for use with Minecraft Note Blocks.

Some of those tools include:

- NBX Studio

    NBX Studio aims to provide a cross-platform Note Block song editor. It is similar to [Note Block Studio](http://www.stuffbydavid.com/mcnbs),
    but with more features, including loops.
- NoteBlock Exporter

    A tool to convert Note Block songs into schematics or Lua scripts, for importing into the game. Can also convert to miscellaneous formats, such as MIDI.
    Supports many features, including a built-in wireless song exporter. This is the same exporter as the one in NBX Studio.
- NoteBetter

    A Minecraft mod which allows users and server admins to configure Note Blocks and add custom instruments. Doesn't need to be installed on the client.
